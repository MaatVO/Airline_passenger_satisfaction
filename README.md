# Airline passenger satisfaction

Welcome to the Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction project! This repository hosts the code and resources for a machine learning-driven analysis to predict passenger satisfaction for airlines. The goal of this project is to leverage state-of-the-art ML techniques and data analysis to gain insights into factors that influence passenger satisfaction and build predictive models for airlines to enhance their services and overall customer experience.

## Introduction
_This was a project made by 3 students, including me, for a university course on statistical learning._

Customer satisfaction is a critical aspect of the airline industry, directly impacting loyalty, reputation, and revenue. To help airlines better understand and cater to their passengers' needs, this project utilizes various machine learning techniques and data analysis to predict passenger satisfaction based on historical airline data. By accurately predicting satisfaction levels, airlines can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance their services.

In this project, we aim to accomplish the following:

**Data Collection**: We gathered a comprehensive dataset containing various features related to airline travel, including flight details, services, and passenger demographics.

**Data Preprocessing**: Raw data is often noisy and incomplete. We performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and prepared the dataset for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA): EDA is crucial to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between different variables. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we reveal patterns and trends that may impact passenger satisfaction.

**Machine Learning Models**: We deployed machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. These models will learn from historical data to predict passenger satisfaction accurately.

**Evaluation and Interpretation**: We assess the performance of our models using various metrics and interpret the results to identify key factors influencing passenger satisfaction.

**Recommendations**: Based on the findings, we provide actionable recommendations for airlines to improve customer satisfaction, enhance their services, and foster better passenger experiences.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It comprises a vast array of attributes, including flight details, customer feedback, and other relevant information.
